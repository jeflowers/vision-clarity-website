                <h4 data-i18n="services.presbyopia.monovision_title">Monovision LASIK</h4>
                <p data-i18n="services.presbyopia.monovision_text">In this approach, one eye is corrected for distance vision and the other for near vision. Your brain learns to use the appropriate eye depending on what you're looking at. This can reduce or eliminate the need for reading glasses.</p>
                
                <h4 data-i18n="services.presbyopia.multifocal_title">Multifocal LASIK</h4>
                <p data-i18n="services.presbyopia.multifocal_text">Using advanced laser technology, we can create multiple focus zones on your cornea, allowing clear vision at various distances. This advanced technique can provide excellent results for appropriate candidates.</p>
                
                <h4 data-i18n="services.presbyopia.rle_title">Refractive Lens Exchange (RLE)</h4>
                <p data-i18n="services.presbyopia.rle_text">For some patients, especially those over 50, replacing the eye's natural lens with an advanced multifocal lens implant may be the best option. This procedure is similar to cataract surgery but is performed before cataracts develop.</p>
