          <div class="faq-question">How do I schedule a consultation?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            You can schedule a consultation by calling our office at (800) 555-2020, using our online scheduling tool on our website, or emailing us at info@eyecarecenter.com. Our staff will help find a time that works best for you.

          <div class="faq-question">How long does the consultation take?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Initial consultations typically take 60-90 minutes. This includes time for comprehensive eye testing, discussion of your vision goals, and answering any questions you may have about potential treatments.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What should I bring to my consultation?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Please bring your current glasses and/or contact lenses, a list of medications you're taking, your vision insurance information, and any previous eye exam records if available. Also, it's helpful to prepare a list of questions you may have about your vision and treatment options.

          <div class="faq-question">How should I prepare for my eye exam?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            For your eye exam, we recommend getting plenty of rest the night before. If you wear contact lenses, please remove them at least 24 hours before your appointment for soft lenses, or several days for rigid lenses. Avoid applying eye makeup on the day of your exam, and bring sunglasses as your eyes may be sensitive after dilation.

          <div class="faq-question">What is the cost of LASIK surgery?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            The cost of LASIK surgery typically ranges from $2,000 to $3,000 per eye, depending on the technology used and your specific vision needs. We provide comprehensive pricing during your consultation that includes pre-operative care, the procedure itself, and post-operative follow-up appointments.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Am I a good candidate for LASIK?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Good LASIK candidates are typically 18 years or older with stable vision for at least a year, have adequate corneal thickness, and do not have certain eye conditions like severe dry eye or glaucoma. During your consultation, we'll perform comprehensive testing to determine if LASIK is right for you or if another procedure might be more suitable.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What is the recovery time after LASIK?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Most patients experience improved vision within 24 hours after LASIK. You'll need someone to drive you home after the procedure, and you should plan to rest for the remainder of that day. Many patients return to work within 1-2 days, though you should avoid strenuous activities for about a week. Complete healing typically occurs within 3-6 months.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What alternatives to LASIK do you offer?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            We offer several alternatives to LASIK, including PRK (Photorefractive Keratectomy), SMILE (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction), implantable contact lenses (ICL), and refractive lens exchange (RLE). During your consultation, we'll discuss which option might be best for your specific vision needs and eye health.
