      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "question1": "Am I a good candidate for LASIK?",
      "answer1": "Good candidates for LASIK are typically 18 years or older with stable vision for at least one year. A comprehensive eye exam during your consultation will determine if LASIK is right for you based on your eye health, prescription, and corneal thickness.",
      "question2": "Is LASIK painful?",
      "answer2": "LASIK is generally not painful. We use numbing eye drops before the procedure, and patients typically feel only slight pressure during the brief surgery. Some mild discomfort, irritation, or dryness may occur during the first 24-48 hours of recovery.",
      "question3": "How long does recovery take?",
      "answer3": "Most patients notice improved vision immediately after surgery, with vision continuing to stabilize over the next few days. Many return to work within 1-2 days. Complete healing may take 3-6 months, though most visual stabilization occurs within the first few weeks.",
      "question4": "How much does LASIK cost?",
      "answer4": "The cost of LASIK at Vision Clarity Institute ranges from $1,800 to $2,500 per eye, depending on your specific vision needs and the technology selected. We offer flexible financing options with affordable monthly payments."

      "how_works_title": "How It Works",
      "how_works_text": "During traditional LASIK, our surgeon uses a microkeratome (surgical blade) to create a thin flap in the cornea. The flap is then lifted, and an excimer laser reshapes the corneal tissue underneath to correct your vision. The flap is then repositioned to serve as a natural bandage while healing occurs.",

      "how_works_title": "How It Works",
      "how_works_text": "In Custom Bladeless LASIK, we use two different lasers: a femtosecond laser to create the corneal flap (instead of a blade), and an advanced wavefront-guided excimer laser for corneal reshaping. This all-laser approach allows for more precise flap creation and customized treatment based on your unique corneal map.",

Our surgeons will assess your specific needs during your consultation."

      "how_works_title": "How It Works",
      "how_works_text": "During PRK, the surgeon gently removes the outer layer of the cornea (epithelium) instead of creating a flap. An excimer laser then reshapes the cornea to correct your vision. The epithelium naturally regenerates within a few days after the procedure.",
      "candidates_title": "Ideal Candidates for PRK",
