      "description": "Traditional LASIK is our standard laser vision correction procedure that has helped millions of people worldwide reduce or eliminate their dependence on glasses and contacts.",
      "howWorksTitle": "How It Works",
      "howWorksDescription": "During traditional LASIK, our surgeon uses a microkeratome (surgical blade) to create a thin flap in the cornea. The flap is then lifted, and an excimer laser reshapes the corneal tissue underneath to correct your vision. The flap is then repositioned to serve as a natural bandage while healing occurs.",

      "candidatesDescription": "You may be a good candidate for traditional LASIK if you:",
      "candidates": [
        "Are at least 18 years of age",
        "Have stable vision for at least one year",
        "Have moderate nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism",
        "Have sufficient corneal thickness",
        "Have no significant eye health issues"
      ],
      "recoveryTitle": "Recovery & Results",
      "recoveryDescription": "Most patients experience improved vision within 24 hours after surgery. Full recovery typically takes 1-2 weeks, with stable vision usually achieved within one month. Traditional LASIK has a high success rate, with approximately 96% of patients achieving their desired vision."
